of the project, and only with the project sponsor's approval, the code will be 
released to the public domain under the Apache 2.0 license, which enables nearly
limitless reproduction, use of (for profit or not), modification, distribution, 
etc. of the code found in this project (see notice below). Code used in this 
project is often borrowed or based on the work of others, whose credit the

1. Code used in this project draws from the example projects for the XMEGAA1 
   XPLAIN board and the drivers for the XMEGA series, distributed by the Atmel 
   Corporation. The author would like to thank Atmel for their work in 
   developing and supporting the XMEGA chip series, as well as for the 
   sample code, tutorials, and evaluation boards they provide for the XMEGA 
   series.

2. Dr.John R. Ridgley, Cal Poly ME Professor, whose code developed for and 
   instruction in the ME 405 (mechatronics) class at Cal Poly have enabled the 
   author to advance this project in earnest.

Additionally, this project would not be possible without the contributions of 
the following.

1. Wawona Frozen Foods, based in Clovis, California, for sponsoring the 
   project. In particular, credit should be given to Bill Smittcamp, Brian 
   Okland, Jose Valdez, Vincent Olliver, and Duncan Dowdle for their 
   investment in the project, both monetary and personal.

   inspiring direction and deep technical knowledge have enabled the Pit Crew to
   succeed in developin a novel concept, from requirement generation to 
   prototype demonstration.
